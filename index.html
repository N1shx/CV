  <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
  The world of computers is growing at a rapid rate everyday. Computers are the most influential tools in our lives especially today, they are our present and our future as well.
  In my opinion nothing on the planet can measure the exponential growth and excitement in the technology and computing industry.
  I have been watching the digital revolution sculpting the society we live in, at the rate I haven't seen before.
  The upcoming new technologies everyday fascinate me alot and that is why I want to be a part of this industry, particularly the Software Engineering
  <br />
  <br />
  I am a student in MIT's class of 2026, pursuing a major in Computer Science.
  I have been studying computer science since my sophomore year in high school as I had it in my curriculum during my Cambridge IGCSE Examinations
  I am comfortable coding in C, C++, Python, Java, Java Script and HTML.
  <br />
  <br />
  Apart from the classes, I'm often doing extra research or certification courses related to computer science and all its other branches.
